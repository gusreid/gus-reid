Hi, I'm Gus; student, questioner, mover.

I guide individuals and groups towards a more empowered, playful, grounded relationship to movement, their bodies and life.

I've learned through hard experience that staying within the "known" leads to ever-decreasing openness; contracting us *into* our experience, limiting our freedom of movement and expression. Whether we're talking about having limited range of joint movement or being stuck in an emotional pattern, the principle is the same - if you don't consistently move your body and mind into the unknown your life will shrink and you will invite in disconnection, rigidness, atrophy and dis-ease. 

Teaching our bodies to move into the unknown is the key to physical, mental and emotional freedom and empowerment. 

This is what's made the biggest difference in my life and so what better way to express my appreciation for my own freedom and empowerment than to commit my energy to guiding supporting others on their journey.

#### How does this look?
*Power lies in making distinctions, freedom lies in destroying them.*
— Peter Ralston

I use a nonlinear approach to movement; working on *all* the ways muscles and fascia interact with the structures of the body and the environment. Not just strength, mobility and flexibility. But also muscle elasticity, spiral dynamics (fascia integration), rhythm, coordination and vestibular training (balance) - all rooted in solid experientially-verifiable principles.

I encourage my students to investigate life *existentially* - meaning looking into matters and seeking to experientially discover how they actually exist and why they exist that way. This is as true of the body as it is of the human condition. The more conscious we are of how things exist the more empowered we are to make finer adjustments in our experience and move our biological organism towards balance and homeostasis. 

At the same time we are free to destroy distinctions that limit us or create suffering. Many of our beliefs and assumptions we hold about ourselves, our bodies and life are just plain wrong. Relating to life trough an erroneous lens has significant consequences for our health, alignment and wellbeing. The more conscious we become the better able we are to discover the root assumptions holding us back from being the most genuine, authentic expression of ourselves and let them go; promoting ever-increasing degrees of freedom. 

In the Cheng Hsin Arts, developed by [Peter Ralston](https://chenghsin.com/who-is-peter-ralston/), we use several principles to move the body and mind towards a true and authentic experience. 

In the Body-Being work we work to investigate, discover and embody the *Five Principles of an Effortlessly-Effective Body*. 
- Being Calm
- Relaxing
- Moving from the centre
- Being grounded, and
- Feeling the whole body (and the space around the body)

To this end we play with many methods, drills and techniques, which will improve your mobility, coordination and balance; increase your awareness and reaction time, develop your feeling-awareness and ability to generate feeling-states that have desirable outcomes in physical alignment and expression -  and to generally improve your experience of your body and its relationship to your environment. 

You can engage solely on the level of techniques and drills and you will get a lot from the practice to improve your health. But in my one-to-one work we dive even deeper into the principles, which is where you begin to develop a profoundly deep and honest relationship to your body. Which is to say you'll begin the process of letting go of conditioned reactions and habits that distort and limit your true and authentic expression - moving you in the direction of living as your true self -  the one you were meant to be. 

This work can be approached superficially or we can go deep into mind training and investigating the human condition.

#### Why work with me?
Well, I'm nothing special. I've not achieved anything outwardly spectacular with my body (yet). Why is that a good thing? Well, I've been in the trenches with the my body and mind. And at (nearly) fifty years old my body is the healthiest it has ever been, and it is only improving with each day that passes. 

I was born with a musculoskeletal condition called *pectus excavatum*; a whole-body condition that manifests most obviously as a concaved chest. Growing up with this condition made breathing difficult and movement painful. I was racked with injuries as a child, and shied away from sports and physical activity.  I wasn't even remotely athletic until I was well into my forties. 

To distract me from the pain I developed coping strategies like chronic nail-biting. I had all manner of ticks and other bodily neuroses. As a teenager I discovered drugs and alcohol, and they became my escape. 

After a radical decline in health, back in 2010, I walked away from a lifestyle of all-night parties, drugs, booze and general debauchery. And I started turning *towards* my problems instead of running away. This sparked a passion for learning about movement, health and consciousness. 

Decades of escapism left me numb and very disconnected from my body and feelings. Learning to feel again was very uncomfortable in the beginning. But a deep yearning for truth and alignment has kept me committed. That *commitment* and *intent*, along with a *questioning disposition* and an ever-increasing *openness* has served me in my pursuit for deeper understanding. 

I had every reason to live by limiting stories about my body and my health. But I have overcome them by becoming more conscious of my body and it's place in the universe. 

As the say, "The truth will set you free". By understanding your situation you are empowered to stop doing the things that cause suffering and pain - to make choices and create states that have desirable outcomes instead. 

This is truly the crux of my work - to empower you with the knowledge, experience and tools to change your state and move your life in the direction is was intended for. 

#### Reframing practice
Movement is about more than just getting fit, being "functional", longevity or preventing illness. The body offers feedback on how our minds work. Movement has the potential to be the vehicle through which we awaken unrecognised aspects of our mind; revealing emotional dispositions towards self, life and others. As we free ourselves from these dispositions we learn to rest as Being. 

As we become more aligned with, *and centred in*, our essential nature we have more possibility to generate internal states that move us in a satisfying, aligning, competent and graceful direction - the world begins to open up for us and shit just works right! 

I'm passionate about movement; not only as a therapeutic tool, but as vehicle for transformation. And it's my joy to share the potential of movement to awaken the wisdom of the body.
