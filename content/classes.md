# Classes:

#### Online Classes:

What's possible when we live our lives from a state of relaxed, open, grounded awareness; meeting life centred in our being, whole and complete? 

My classes are aimed at creating the conditions that give your body experiences that are in harmony with your true nature; to provide an experiential contrast to the habits of the conditioned mind; opening up the possibility of new and improved experiences. 

##### Learn to be more alive, present, embodied, balanced and whole, by...

##### Exploring the five principles of an effortlessly effective body-being. 
- Being calm
- Relaxing
- Moving from the centre
- Being grounded
- Feeling the whole body and the space around the body

###### Through...
- Visualisation and feeling-states
- Task-oriented training
- Pandiculation and intrinsic pleasure
- Resurfacing and rewiring subconscious patterns

At the moment I am doing 7am (UK), Mondays and Wednesdays, and 9am (UK) Saturdays. 
Am open to adding some evening sessions if there is interest.
