## In-Person Classes: 
What's possible when we live our lives from a state of **relaxed**, **open**, **grounded** awareness; meeting life **centred** in our being, **whole and complete**? 

**Using a playful, non-linear approach, I help spark open investigation, cultivate connection, release tension and promote structural alignment.**

**With a unique blend of *task-oriented games* and *feeling-imagery*, we explore overlooked ways of promoting *adaptation*, to improve**
- Balance, rhythm & coordination
- Mobility and flexibility
- Structural alignment
- Elastic properties of the body

I'll be guiding you in a non-dogmatic movement practice grounded in sold principles from the eastern arts; translated into a modern language and expression, making it practical, accessible and transferable to your everyday life. There is a strong focus on *adaptation* - preparing your body for the unpredictable nature of life. My goal is to help you free yourself from generic, linear, ritualised practice and to help you live from a spontaneously responsive and resilient body. Not just improving within the practice itself, but adapting and thriving within the realities of life.

*Classes are open to all ages, genders and abilities. All tasks, games and coordinations can be scaled to your individual ability. This is a practice that will support and enhance any other practice, discipline or therapy you are currently engaged in.*
