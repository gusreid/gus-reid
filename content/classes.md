What's possible when we live our lives from a state of relaxed, open, grounded awareness; meeting life centred in our being, whole and complete? 

My in-person classes are aimed at creating the conditions that give your body experiences that are in harmony with your true nature; to provide an experiential contrast to the habits of the conditioned mind; opening up the possibility of new and improved experiences. 

There are three main areas of research we will explore:
1. Rhythm of Being (pandiculation and Intrinsic Pleasure)
2. The Principles of Artful Movement
3. Task-Oriented Training

Most classes will have a little of each, but some classes will have an emphasis on one area, which will be reflected in the name of the class.

## Rhythm of Being:

Discover the fullness of Being.

A powerful but gentle class where we practice cultivating a relationship with the intelligence of the body through pandiculation and movement. This is a time to slow down, to get in touch with our bodies, leaning into what feels good and moving our bodies in nourishing ways. A practice to learn to surrender the conscious mind to the pace and rhythms of the body, returning us to our natural state as being.

I will offer guidance, cues and visualisations throughout the class, but mostly you will be moving in your own way, tapping into your intuition through pandiculation, and following what feels good.

It might be nice to have a yoga mat for this one, but not absolutely necessary.


## The Principles of Artful Movement:

Discover the jewel at the heart of every true movement art. 

Influenced by Peter Ralston's powerful body of work - and drawing from martial principles - this is a class exploring what it is to be a body and cultivating the principles that make being a body joyful and effortless. 

- Being calm
- Relaxing
- Being grounded
- Moving from the centre
- Feeing the whole body

To have any real and lasting effect in changing the structures of the body, we must not only train it but also train the mind. For this we combine movement with visualisations, or "feeling-states", so we can bypass the conscious mind and quickly bring about new experiences that harmonise the body with its evolutionary design. By cultivating and embodying these five principles we begin to move and live from a state of thoughtless action; a state of integration with ourselves and our environment. 

Whether you want to compliment your existing movement practice - or just want to cultivate and maintain healthy, efficient movement - this class is for anyone with a body, no matter your skill level. 


## Task-Oriented Training

Maintain and improve neuronal health through play!

Telling you what to do is one way of getting you moving. But that way has quite limiting results, and is, quite frankly, unrewarding. I prefer turning it into a game or task; creating certain constraints and inviting you to find your own way to complete the task. 

This way keeps you engaged in the process, which teaches the body much more than busting out reps and sets of a linear movement - plus it's a lot more fun!

There will be Jenga blocks and tennis-balls-on-strings!

We'll work on drills that teach:
- Balance
- Coordination
- Rhythm
- Relaxation

Tasks can be adjusted to accommodate all ages and abilities. So everyone can benefit and is welcome to these classes.

Bring a curious and playful attitude!
