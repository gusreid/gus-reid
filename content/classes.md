- Being calm
- Relaxing
- Moving from the centre
- Being grounded
- Feeling the whole body and the space around the body

**In order to discover and embody these principles we explore...**
- Visualisation and feeling-states
- Task-oriented games
- Mobility, balance, rhythm and coordination drills
- Structure and alignment

If you've ever been to a **tai chi**, **chi gong** or **yoga** class you'll find much of what I teach and facilitate familiar. The difference here is I will be facilitating you to have a direct experience of the underlying principles that those arts arose from - the essence of the arts, if you will. Not only will you learn what to do, but also *how to be*. My goal is to break free from dogma and ritual and to help you move in the direction of embodied **power**, **grace** and **resilience**. 

Classes are between 1 to 1.5 hours.
There are limited yoga mats, so it might be an idea to bring your own, if you have one. 
**Bring a curious and playful attitude!**
