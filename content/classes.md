## In-Person Classes: 
What's possible when we live our lives from a state of **relaxed**, **open**, **grounded** awareness; meeting life **centred** in our being, **whole and complete**? 

**Using [Cheng Hsin](https://chenghsin.com/) taiji principles and a playful, non-linear approach, I help spark open investigation, cultivate connection, foster the release of tension and promote structural alignment.**

**We use a unique blend of...**
- Visualisation and feeling-states
- Task-oriented games
- Mobility, balance, rhythm and coordination drills
- & Structure and alignment points

If you've ever been to a **tai chi**, **chi gong** or **yoga** class you'll find much of what I teach and facilitate familiar. The difference here is we explore non-linear approaches to movement, preparing your body for the unpredictable nature of life. My goal is to break free from generic, ritualised practice and to help you move in the direction of living from a spontaneously responsive and resilient body. 

Classes are open to all ages and abilities. All tasks, games and coordinations can be scaled to your individual ability. So don't feel like anything will be too much for you (or too little). If you're getting older and starting to lose your mobility, I think you will enjoy these classes as a fun way to maintain and increase your physical ability. And if you have an existing practice or sport you will find the principles and structural points I teach very supportive of any endeavour you pursue with a body. 

So pop on some comfy clothes and come be surprised at what you can do!

**Classes are between 1 to 1.5 hours.**

Note: At the Treflach Farm venue there are limited yoga mats, so it might be an idea to bring your own, if you have one. We don't always use them, but they can be handy.

**And bring a curious and playful attitude!**
