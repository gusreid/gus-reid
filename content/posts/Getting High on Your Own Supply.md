##### Psychedelics
###### A path to higher consciousness or a trap?

Having participated in several dozen ayahuasca, huyachuma and mushroom ceremonies - even going through intense training with the Shipibo tribe of the Amazon to become a curandero. Having had hundreds of "less formal" experiences with LSD, mushrooms and various other natural and synthetic psychedelics, from age 13, right up until my mid-forties. And, contrasting the results of all those experiences with those of the internal and external arts, and contemplative practices I've been committed to over the last 13 years, I would like to share some perspective on my observations of the usefulness and sustainability of psychedelic-use for the purpose of transformation - or, what I call, living lucidly. 

What I see psychedelics are good for is shaking up your context. Perhaps to show you what's possible when your energy is up. Beyond that I believe they have limited use and can be a trap for for many.

By trap I mean something very specific. In my experience we are capable of consistently entering into the states that psychedelics provide without them. Psychedelics can open and relax the body-mind enough to experience high-energy states. Like I say, this is powerful in that it shows us what is possible for our growth and evolution. In the light of that possibility powerful "healings" can occur. And whilst I'm open to some of those healings being "permanent", in my experience, most of them are not. Why? Because the habits of mind that created the conditions for dis-ease have not been habituated to a new context. Thus many so-called "healings" are generally reversed with a few weeks or months. The person involved may have changed some *content* of mind, but they have not changed their *context*. Changing one's context requires much more than insight or the release of trapped energy, it requires placing consistent attention on the source of the condition and intending for an outcome that is increasingly in alignment with truth. And that takes discipline and focus. Two things I believe have a tendency to atrophy in regular psychedelic-users. Our body's ability to contain and sustain high-energy states weakens and atrophies when we become physically and psychologically dependant on an outside source for raising our energy and healing our body-mind - leading to loss of tone in our energy-body. 

The body, in its infinite wisdom, will always try to save energy. So when we don't use certain tissues and pathways, the body stops maintaining them and they go dormant. Depending how long they have been offline will depend on how much time and effort it will take to reawaken them. Imagine putting an arm in a sling for six months. The muscles will atrophy and will take a lot of work to bring them back to their functional state. Psychedelics are like that sling. They are helpful in that they allow a certain amount of healing to happen, but all the time you are losing strength. At some point we need to step beyond them and start doing some metaphorical bicep curls in order to reach our full potential. I could even make an argument that they provide a false sense of growth and that when one gives them up one must start from the beginning again anyway; albeit with a new sense of possibility. 

There are those that have been drinking Ayahuasca regularly for ten, twenty, thirty years... and they're proud of it! I'm not here to criticise those people, but to show you that you don't need to do that. Unless you are working as a healer in that domain I don't see any reason why one would need to have any more than a handful of ceremonies *in a lifetime*. In-between, following a structured and disciplined practice to fulfil the insights and maintain the energy-increase experienced therein. And even if one is a shaman/ curandero or whatever, I would still consider questioning whether taking "medicine" every ceremony is a good idea for the big picture of their life and their continued expansion and growth. It's what you do in between that makes the difference. It's what you're doing now. It's what you do when your energy does drop. Do you run to the next ceremony, or do you take a look around and identify the conditions of your life, your mind, your energy. Do you consider the choices you're making in every moment? The real and sustainable growth happens in the day-to-day experiences and how you respond to them.

###### The Brain as a Medicine Cabinet

Our brains are medicine cabinets. Every time you take something outside of you to change your inner state it pays to consider the message you are sending to your body. The brain will not produce "happy juice" if it's getting it from a plant or pill. You will block the body's intrinsic ability to create these medicines, and consequently inhibit its healing capacity, if you hold it that you need a plant or shaman to heal you. Keep seeking extrinsic pleasure and it will inevitably lead to pain. Be aware of integrating the lessons learned in those experiences and take pause to assess the conditions of your life before running to drugs the next time things appear to become derailed. Take responsibility next time things become challenging in your life. Ask yourself, "Who have I been *being* in order to attract this experience?" Work to strengthen yourself internally while mapping out the patterns that pull you into pockets of dense energy. At the core of these dense pockets you will find a belief or assumption about yourself or life. Once identified, you can train your body-mind to release your craving or resistance to experiencing the reality that the belief is based on. 

###### Practice

A simple technique for this (which I've adapted from something I learned from Frederick Dodson) is to:
1. Ask, "What's bothering me right now?"
2. Identify and place your attention on a thought, sensation or situation that is bothering you in this moment. Wrap your conscious awareness around the object of your attention. Find its edges, its boundaries. Envelop it completely.
3. Ask, "Am I willing to let this go?"
4. If so, allow yourself to let go of your attachment or resistance to whatever thought, feeling or situation you identified. 
5. Then ask again, "What is bothering me now?"
6. And repeat the whole process again and again until you begin to feel relief. 

Eventually your body-mind gets this process and you don't need to ask the questions any more. You simply put your attention on what is bothering you and release resistance to experiencing it. It's quite mechanical and very effective. You can think of the "placing attention" step as *acceptance*. There's no question of letting go until one has accepted what is. Once accepted and acknowledged *then* you can locate the aspect of yourself that is resisting that experience. The layering on of resistance to an experience is always of the mind, and therefore unnecessary. Once seen in this light it becomes a simple mechanical act of letting go. 

###### Summary

My point with this article is not to criticise psychedelic use, but to put these compounds in their place. There is a growing culture that seem to be putting their eggs all in one basket and holding psychedelics as being a panacea. And yet when I take a critical look at the results within this culture they appear a little underwhelming. 

I know people who live a perfectly lucid life and have never taken drugs of any kind. And I know countless people who take psychedelics regularly who's lives, health and relationships spiral into chaos just as regularly. 

If you are going to experiment with these drugs then I suggest you look into the experience they provide critically; assess what it is about those states that are so healing, cathartic and high-energy; and find ways of recreating them without the drugs. There is an abundance of tools, techniques and practices that act as vehicles to those realms, and actually strengthen you rather than weaken you. Putting some energetic skin in the game makes the journey more sustainable and you'll be living a lucid and expansive life without being bound to any culture or compound. 

If you intend to experience higher states and healing states without assaulting the psyche with extrinsic compounds, and believe that you can, and keep your focus on that outcome, then you can and will. 

As always I am committed to the expansion of humanity through individual empowerment. With these articles I expect to spark these qualities in my reader.
