## 1-to-1 Sessions and Individualised Programmes:

My goal is to help you live a lucid and empowered life through releasing attachment to mind-identification and allowing yourself to just be. There are two domains of study I am equipped to support you with in this pursuit:
- Cultivating awareness through the body, and
- Ontological investigation

These two domains of study work hand-in-hand, and students that study both have the best results. 
### Cultivating awareness through the b# Work with Me
I know from experience that making lasting changes in the body can be a confusing and overwhelming challenge. Having someone to help you create a strategy and to show you the pitfalls can be very helpful in your process. 

My goal in our work together is to empower you to be able to navigate the change process. For this you will need a certain amount of education. 

There are three areas we will be focused on:
1. Pain-neuroscience
2. Adaptation and tissue healing-times 
3. Progressive overload

Studying *and practicing* these three areas will set you up for a meaningful and lifelong movement practice. You will be left with an experiential understanding of why pain exists, how to manage it, how to overcome pain and get stronger and more mobile, and how to progress within your practice over a lifetime. Moving you towards goals that will increase your health and energy levels. 

On top of the education component is **practice, practice, practice...**
## Individualised Programmes
If you want to really change something about your body you need consistent, intelligent inputs over a long period. There are no short cuts when it comes to true, authentic and long-lasting change. 

I offer 5-week and 12-week programmes. 

I always recommend working with at least 12-week blocks of training to get the best results. But I understand that this is not always financially viable for some people; so I also offer 5-week programmes. 

With each programme you will get access to my educational portal and an orientation call with me, where we will address your challenges and obstacles, and identify some goals that are meaningful to your life. 

From there we will *co-create* a programme based on what came up in the call. 

I will be available via WhatsApp throughout the duration of your programme to give feedback on any videos you wish to send, and to answer your questions. 

If you are on the 12-week programme we will adjust your programme every 4 weeks to make sure you're progressing effectively towards your goals.

ody:

It's my experience that the mind and body are inextricably linked. In fact, it's more accurate to say that there is no mind-body *disconnection* to begin with. However, due to cultural and social conventions, we grow up in an environment that teaches us otherwise. And so a perceived separation seems to happen. And that perceived experience has very real consequences for our health and vitality. These mental and emotional habits, assumptions and dispositions show up in our posture and physiology. Through movement, and orientation towards *intrinsic pleasure*, we get to map out these apparent *dis*integrated aspects, re-experience them in a new context, and work to reintegrate them into our experience; harmonising mind, body and emotions. 

*The body doesn't lie.*

The body knows how to heal. One-to-one sessions are an opportunity to explore tools that uncover the body's intuitive healing capacity; moving us towards alignment, harmony, strength, power, pleasure and vitality. 

I also offer personalised movement programs, designed around your needs and goals.

Depending where you are in your relationship with your body depends on where we will start. 

### Ontological investigation:

#### "It's not the answer that enlightens, it's the question."
— Eugene Ionesco
##### Ontology
- *The branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being.*

Through asking questions we get to reveal the uncognised mind and become conscious of the habits that keep us stuck in disempowering cycles. Questions narrow the focus of the mind into a single point. When the mind is focused in this way it becomes a powerful tool for penetrating and dissecting the uncognised mind; helping us to let go of unnecessary dispositions, revealing an ever-present state of Being. 

*One good question, properly aimed, can change a life.*

In the communication of our experience to another we reveal the uncognised mind and clear space, allowing us to rest in the presence of who we are. As we learn to identify with Being, rather than acting out from the conditioned reactive mind, we begin to see that all the tension, resistance, pain and discomfort we experience is actually something we are actively creating in the now. From this presence and clear-seeing we are empowered to disengage from such activities and relax into who and what we are.
