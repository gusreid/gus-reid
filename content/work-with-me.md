## Individualised Programmes
If you want to learn a new skill, overcome a challenge or simply change something about your body you need consistent, intelligent inputs over a long period. True, authentic and long-lasting change is born from consistency.

I offer **5-week** and **12-week** programmes. 
 
The current scientific research shows that the best results come from programmes of 12 weeks or more. But I understand that this is not always financially viable for some people; so I also offer 5-week programmes. 

With each programme you will get access to my educational videos and an orientation call with me, where we will address your challenges and obstacles, and identify some goals that are meaningful to your life. 

From there we will *co-create* a programme based on what came up in the call. Programmes may include a combination of *strength*, *mobility*, *rhythm & coordination* and *balance* training. It all depends on your goals and needs. Starting off where you are and gaining in complexity as you progress. 

I will be available via WhatsApp throughout the duration of your programme to give feedback on any videos you wish to send, and to answer your questions. 

If you are on the **12-week** programme we will adjust your programme every *4 weeks* to ensure you're progressing effectively towards your goals.
