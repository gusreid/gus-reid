title: Work with Me
---

I know from experience that making lasting changes in the body can be a confusing and overwhelming challenge. Having someone to help you create a strategy and to show you the pitfalls can be very helpful in your process. 

My goal in our work together is to empower you to be able to navigate the change process. For this you will need a certain amount of education. 

There are three areas we will be focused on:
1. Pain-neuroscience
2. Adaptation and tissue healing-times 
3. Progressive overload

Studying *and practicing* these three areas will set you up for a meaningful and lifelong movement practice. You will be left with an experiential understanding of why pain exists, how to manage it, how to overcome pain and get stronger and more mobile, and how to progress within your practice over a lifetime. Moving you towards goals that will increase your health and energy levels. 

On top of the education component is **practice, practice, practice...**
## Individualised Programmes
If you want to really change something about your body you need consistent, intelligent inputs over a long period. There are no short cuts when it comes to true, authentic and long-lasting change. 

I offer 5-week and 12-week programmes. 

I always recommend working with at least 12-week blocks of training to get the best results. But I understand that this is not always financially viable for some people; so I also offer 5-week programmes. 

With each programme you will get access to my educational portal and an orientation call with me, where we will address your challenges and obstacles, and identify some goals that are meaningful to your life. 

From there we will *co-create* a programme based on what came up in the call. 

I will be available via WhatsApp throughout the duration of your programme to give feedback on any videos you wish to send, and to answer your questions. 

If you are on the 12-week programme we will adjust your programme every 4 weeks to make sure you're progressing effectively towards your goals.

## Live 1-to-1 Coaching
Sometimes people need closer guidance in the beginning of their journey towards moving better. So I also offer 1-to-1 in-person or online coaching calls. 

These are best used in conjunction with a 5- or 12-week programme.
