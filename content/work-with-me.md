## 1-to-1 Sessions and Individualised Programmes:

My goal is to help you live a lucid and empowered life through releasing attachment to mind-identification and allowing yourself to just be. There are two domains of study I am equipped to support you with in this pursuit:
- Cultivating awareness through the body, and
- Ontological investigation

### Cultivating awareness through the body:

It's my experience that the mind and body are inextricably linked. In fact, it's more accurate to say that there is *no* mind-body disconnection to begin with. However, due to cultural and social conventions, we grow up in an environment that teaches us otherwise. And so a separation appears to happen in our experience. Through movement, and orientation towards *intrinsic pleasure*, we get to map out these apparent *dis*integrated aspects and work to reintegrate them into our experience. 

*The body doesn't lie.*

The body knows how to heal. One-to-one sessions are an opportunity to explore tools that uncover the body's intuitive healing capacity; moving us towards alignment, harmony, strength, power, pleasure and vitality. 

I also offer personalised movement programs, designed around your needs and goals.

Depending where you are in your relationship with your body depends on where we will start. 

### Ontological investigation:

#### "It's not the answer that enlightens, it's the question."
— Eugene Ionesco
##### Ontology
- *The branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being.*

Through asking questions we get to reveal the uncognised mind and become conscious of the habits that keep us stuck in disempowering cycles. Questions narrow the focus of the mind into a single point. When the mind is focused in this way it becomes a powerful tool for penetrating and dissecting the uncognised mind; helping us to let go of unnecessary dispositions, revealing an ever-present state of Being. 

*One good question, properly aimed, can change a life.*

As we learn to identify with Being, rather than acting out from the conditioned reactive mind, we begin to see that all the tension, resistance, pain and discomfort we experience is actually something we are actively creating in the now. From this presence and clear-seeing we are empowered to disengage from such activities and relax into who and what we are.
