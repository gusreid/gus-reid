## 1-to-1 Sessions and Individualised Programmes:

### "It's not the answer that enlightens, it's the question."
â€” Eugene Ionesco

Through asking questions we get to reveal the uncognised mind and become conscious of the habits that keep us stuck in disempowering cycles. Helping us to let go of unnecessary dispositions, freeing us to create a life that's in alignment with our highest purpose. 

One good question, properly aimed, can change a life.
