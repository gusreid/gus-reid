## Your North Star
I know from experience that making lasting changes in the body can be a confusing and overwhelming challenge. Having someone to help you create a strategy and to show you the pitfalls can be very helpful in your process. 

When working with clients I've learned that it is far more effective and empowering to work towards a skill or goal, rather than trying to fix something. Of course, many people come to me with some kind of challenge, pain or problem. And that's fine; that's what got your attention. But as quickly as possible we want to identify a skill that you can work towards which is going to make ***you*** bigger than your problems. It gives us **context** and a **positive orientation** towards practice. *Then*, all the drills and strategies serve that greater purpose. 
#### Education
My goal in our work together is to empower you with the skills, knowledge and experience that will take you towards your movement goals. For this you will need some basic education. 

There are three areas we will be focused on:
1. Pain-neuroscience
2. Adaptation and tissue healing-times 
3. Progressive overload

Studying *and practicing* these three areas will set you up for a meaningful and lifelong movement practice. You will be left with an experiential understanding of why pain exists, how to manage it, how to overcome pain and get stronger and more mobile, and how to progress within your practice over a lifetime - moving you towards goals that will increase your health and energy levels. 

Education is important; it's how we get on the same page and helps with efficient and effective communication by giving us a shared language. But the results come from **practice, practice, practice...**
## Individualised Programmes
If you want to learn a new skill, overcome a challenge or simply change something about your body you need consistent, intelligent inputs over a long period. True, authentic and long-lasting change is born from consistency. 

I offer **5-week** and **12-week** programmes. 

For most people I recommend working with **12-week** blocks of training to get the best results. The current scientific research supports this. But I understand that this is not always financially viable for some people; so I also offer **5-week** programmes. 

With each programme you will get access to my educational portal and an orientation call with me, where we will address your challenges and obstacles, and identify some goals that are meaningful to your life. 

From there we will *co-create* a programme based on what came up in the call. Programmes may include a combination of *tensile*, *elastic* and *stiff*  training, alongside *dynamic conditioning* and *mobility*. Starting off where you are and gaining in complexity as you progress. 

I will be available via WhatsApp throughout the duration of your programme to give feedback on any videos you wish to send, and to answer your questions. 

If you are on the **12-week** programme we will adjust your programme every *4 weeks* to ensure you're progressing effectively towards your goals.

#### Teach a (wo)man to fish...
My hope is that by the end of a 12 week training block you will have the skills, knowledge and experience to keep going on your own - not only to be able to create your *own* meaningful movement practice , but also to be able to understand how to progressively overload the exercises *for life*. 

You may still *want* to work with me further - tweaking your program, exploring new skills, or uncovering self-sabotaging narratives - but you won't *need* me. 
## 1-to-1 Coaching
Sometimes people need closer guidance in the beginning of their journey towards moving better. So I also offer 1-to-1 in-person or online coaching. In these sessions we can address your specific limitations, not only in the physical domain, but also around how your mind may be sabotaging your progress. 

Don't underestimate the mind's role in your condition - whatever it may be. The narratives we hold have a very powerful effect on our bodies and our lives. 

*No deep and lasting change in the body is possible without also addressing the mind.* 

These sessions are best used in conjunction with a 5- or 12-week programme. That way we have a tangible context within which to work. Having a truly meaningful goal very often brings up our resistance to change. This the the perfect opportunity to reveal our conditioned mind and to pivot our energies to align with our values.

#### Use the force...
Whatever you choose to do - work with me, work with another coach, or figure things out on your own - I wish you an expansive and dynamic *body*, *mind* and *life*.
