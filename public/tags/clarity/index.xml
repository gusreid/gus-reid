      <description>Willpower or Intent? Picture this, you go on retreat and you have a breakthrough. Maybe you get to the root of a habit that you formulated in reaction to a traumatic event in your childhood, or you had a direct experience of an existential distinction or principle, like groundedness or space. And you feel amazing - you&amp;rsquo;re rooted in your feeling-awareness - you feel free and light. Your body, mind and being are more effectively aligned to the world.</description>
