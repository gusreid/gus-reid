      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;willpower-or-intent&#34;&gt;Willpower or Intent?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this, you go on retreat and you have a breakthrough. Maybe you get to the root of a habit that you formulated in reaction to a traumatic event in your childhood, or you had a direct experience of an existential distinction or principle, like groundedness or space. And you feel amazing - you&amp;rsquo;re rooted in your feeling-awareness - you feel free and light. Your body, mind and being are more effectively aligned to the world. Tension runs off you like water off a duck&amp;rsquo;s back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
