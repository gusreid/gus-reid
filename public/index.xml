      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Gus,
My mission is to provide kindling to fuel your transformational fire. To help you reconnect with the innate, healing intelligence of you body through movement and self-inquiry.
Through my own 30+ year journey with persistent pain, and the resulting obsession with finding lasting results, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised that for physical interventions to have any real impact (beyond superficial, transient relief) we must be oriented towards an inner transformation - not just one of fixing symptoms and getting back to &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Body-Being Principles: In my principle-based classes I teach the principles that inform what it is to be a body. It takes a little work at first to build them up, but once they start to &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll realise that this is how life should feel. We use imagery and feeling-states to bring about alignments in the body that the conscious mind alone would find too complex to manage. If you keep coming to my classes, and keep studying, practicing and contemplating the principles and points I&amp;rsquo;m teaching, you will transform your experience of your body and your life.</description>
