We hold it that the mind is dependant on the body for its existence, and yet we award the mind great authority in our lives.

Having participated in several dozen ayahuasca, huyachuma and mushroom ceremonies - even going through intense training with the Shipibo tribe of the Amazon to become a curandero. Having had hundreds of \u0026ldquo;less formal\u0026rdquo; experiences with LSD, mushrooms and various other natural and synthetic psychedelics, from age 13, right up until my mid-forties. And, contrasting the results of all those experiences with those of the internal and external arts, and contemplative practices I\u0026rsquo;ve been committed to over the last 13 years, I would like to share some perspective on my observations of the usefulness and sustainability of psychedelic-use for the purpose of transformation - or, what I call, living lucidly.","date":"13 November 2023","image":"//localhost:1313/images/blue-shrooms.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/articles/getting-high-on-your-own-supply/","title":"Getting High on Your Own Supply"},{"content":"Picture this, you go on retreat and you have a breakthrough. Maybe you get to the root of a habit that you formulated in reaction to a traumatic event in your childhood, or you had a direct experience of an existential distinction or principle, like groundedness or space. And you feel amazing - you\u0026rsquo;re rooted in your feeling-awareness and you feel free and light. Your body, mind and being are more effectively aligned to the world.","date":"21 June 2024","image":"//localhost:1313/images/struggle.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/articles/breakthroughs-and-intention/","title":"Breakthroughs and Intention"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a spontaneous bit about MDMA and weed:\nEnjoy, Gus","date":"14 November 2023","image":"//localhost:1313/images/weed.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/articles/drugs/","title":"Drugs: Who Needs Them?"},{"content":"Introduction One of the best things we can do for our health, life and relationships is to train the mind.
